# Linked Data Journalism
A new approach on data journalism: share your data, analysis methods and result visualisations on the web!
See it live on https://linkeddatajournalism.github.io

This application provides a serverless approach to linked data querying and visualization. No http calls are made to execute the queries. Completely generic approach to data analysis, and completely transparant due to query and data publication in the same interface. No magic on any back end server.
